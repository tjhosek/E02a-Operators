A series of functions designed to show basic data manipulation and data types. I have finished every function based off of the comments in each function. One of the hiccups I ran into was using random.shuffle(), as it does not return a shuffled list, but actually affects the passed variable. it was fairly easy to fix once I figured out what was going on.
